<h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>
<p> I've found Trello really useful in helping me prioritise my tasks and guesstimate a realistic time frame, as well as serving as a useful reminder on the quality of what I'm producing.

Visual Studio is working really well for me and allowing me to access my code in the right format whilst making edits.
</p>

<br>

<h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>
<p>Visual studio Code is definitely required as a core element to putting the code together, especially for someone at my level that needs an easy format to help me understand how to put it together, highlight errors and run tests etc..

Trello has been a great help in terms of the ability to visualise my workflow and the systematically run through everything.</p>

<br>

<h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h2>
<p>At the moment, I'm not happy with it but I have another 2 days to complete it. The reason being is that as it currently stands it's a few webpages with content / text inserted. But there's not a lot of design aesthetic to it.

    What I would like to do is customise the font, add some borders, colour and images to create a better aesthetic.
    
    It I had more time I would have planned out more design elements so that It could demonstrate a better CSS focus with it's layout</p>

<br>

<h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>
<p>If I had more time with this project I would have liked to:

    Look at embedding some video content
    Added more links and subcategories to view
    Focused more on the UI / UX ideas
    Added a few more unique functions</p>

<br>

<h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>

<p>The core elements I want to make sure I introduce are:

    Create a working website
    Add individual pages, all of which linked to each other
    Add an image
    Change fonts
    Create a background
    Fade the background
    Change text formatting, location and colour</p>
