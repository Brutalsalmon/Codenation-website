<h2>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h2>
<p> To break down my pages I've decided to have: 
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Index page</strong>  A main landing / splash page using an image and video import function, links in the top acting as buttons / banners</li>
        <li><strong>Unit 1.1</strong>  I'm going to use a similar format for these sections focusing on coloured, centred text and coloured boxes with borders to highlight the challenges/li>
        <li><strong>Unit 1.2</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Unit 1.3</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Unit 2.1</strong></li>
        <li><strong>unit 2.2</strong></li>
    </ul>

<h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites  </h2>
<p>"<strong>Copyright notices</strong>
    Although notices are not a requirement under the Berne Convention, (which states that copyright is automatic, whether you mark your work or not), it was a requirement of some countries covered under the Universal Copyright Convention (UCC). It is strongly recommended that you properly mark your work as the use of notices will make it clear that copyright exists, and help to deter infringement. Please see our fact sheet P-03: Using copyright notices for information on wording you notices.
    <p></p>
    Websites are particularly open to abuse, especially theft of content and images. You should assume that files will be accessed randomly, downloaded as individual chunks, and distributed out of context. It is therefore important to include a copyright notice on as many individually deliverable items as possible:
    <p></p>
    <strong>Image file properties should include a notice.</strong>
    Under Windows for example, right clicking on a image will allow you to bring up the properties dialogue where you may enter details about the file, (though this will only work with certain file types). More typically, your image software will provide a way to insert comments into the file; this is preferred as these are harder to remove.
    <P></P>
    Every page should contain a notice in the visible text (text shown on screen), or at least link to your notice in the body of the page.
    Every delivered file should include a notice in non visible text.
    For example, in HTML files and CSS style-sheets a copyright notice can be included as a comment.
    <p></p>
    Watermarking may be worth considering if you have a lot of valuable images on your site.
    <p></p>
    <strong>Creating websites for third parties</strong>
    If you design web sites for others, it is important for all parties to understand ownership.
    <p></p>
    Ensure that rights are transferred or licences granted as appropriate. For example; the copyright to the site content and design may passed to the client upon payment, along with licenses for more generic code or modules that the designer/developer may build or use.
    In the case of work undertaken in stages, rights or licenses to individual features may be handed over for work completed to date.
    Where material for the web site is sourced from elsewhere, or where third party technologies are to be used, appropriate licenses should be obtained.
    Moral rights: Will the developer be credited for the work on the web site? If so, the developer will also want to reserve the right to remove the credit if the site if later developed in a way that would discredit the original developer.
     <p></p>
    <strong>Copyright registration</strong>
    Websites are one of the easiest things to copy, particularly any written content and images, so registration is particularly important. For information on how to register a website, please see our fact-sheet P-23: Registering websites.
    <p></p>
    <strong>Detecting infringement</strong>
    Copyscape is a useful tool that will compare your web pages to others indexed by Google and return any it finds with matching text.
    <p></p>
    <strong>Dealing with infringement</strong>
    If you notice another web site using your content, the best place to start is by reading our copyright infringement fact sheet
    <p></p>
    It is a good idea to get a copy of the site as it exists at the time, this is useful if the site owner later changes their site in an attempt to disguise the infringement. Wget is a good tool for this and is available as free software under the GNU General Public License.
    <p></p>
    Besides the points outlined in the copyright infringement fact sheet, in some countries the (such as the UK & USA), the ISP (Internet Service Provider), may also have an obligation to uphold the law. An ISP that continues to host infringing material is knowingly permitting the infringement to continue and may therefore be liable.
    <p></p>
    You would need to check that the ISP is covered by this legislation, (as it will vary due to differences in national laws), but this is often a good additional route to pursue, particularly if you have trouble contacting the domain owner, (we have seen occasions where domain records have been falsified to avoid tracing)."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since the creation of the internet more and more considerations have come into place to help monitor and assess. These address:
    <ul>
        <li>The identity of your business</li>
        <li>The right of users to grant consent for the use of their data GDPR </li>
        <li>Your company policies and procedures. This can include aspects such as how you handle complaints that breach data protection, SSL licensing etc....</li>
        <li>Consumer protection </li>
        <li>Accessibility</li>
        <li>Cyber security and protecting personal data</li>
        <li>Respecting copyright</li>
    
    </ul>

<h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h2>
<p> Disabled access is about catering for any potential users that may suffer from sensory or mobility based problems. As an example, someone with a visual impairment may struggle to see the screen partially or entirely. For this we can use a screen reader to convert the text into spoken word OR braille based displays</p>
<p></p>
<p>Adding things like <em>ALT</em> attributes can help with this process by giving the end user a description. This also has meta data and positive search based results for the site. 
</P>
<br>

<h2>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h2>
    <p>The following are a number of files that are suitable for website use:
        https://www.yourhtmlsource.com/starthere/fileformats.html

        <UL>
        <LI>.AVI — Audio/Video Interleaved
        Standard video format supported on the windows platform. They do not stream, however, so you have to download the entire file before you can watch any of it.
        Use » Windows Media Player or pick up WinAmp or QuickTime.</LI>
        <BR>
    
        <li>Cascading StyleSheet
        CSS files are a tool in the repertoire of webmasters that take care of how their websites look. To read more about them, see our CSS tutorials.
        CSS files can be created or edited in any text-editor, like Notepad. Try » TopStyle Lite too, it includes loads of selectors for easy editing.</LI>
        <BR>
        <LI>DOC — Microsoft Word DOCument
        Microsoft Word is the most popular word processing software in the world. You probably won’t come across loads of doc files, but if you do it can be annoying if you haven’t got a program that can open them.
        Buy the hideously expensive » Microsoft Word, or just hope that it came with your computer. You can get a “Word viewer” from Microsoft too, which is free. If both of these go against your religion, you could use the free » Open Office suite, which is pretty damn good.</LI>
        <BR>
        <LI>EXE — EXEcutable file
        If you download a program that you need to install, it will likely come as an exe file.
        Just double click it to install on your PC. Be careful of viruses!</p></LI>
        <BR>
        <LI>.GIF — Graphics Interchange Format
        The most common image format on the Internet. Good for simple images. Read our Image File Formats page for more.
        Your browser can display them, or any image editor.</LI>
        <BR>
        <LI>HTML/ .HTM — HyperText Markup Language file
        Most pages you create for a website will be HTML files — What is HTML?
        You’re reading one right now. Sorted.</LI>
        <BR>
        <LI>JPG/ .JPEG — Joint Photographic Experts Group file
        Another very common image file format, mainly used for photos. Again, for more check out the Image File Formats page.
        Your browser can show them, or an image editor.</LI>
        <BR>
        <LI>MIDI/ .MID — Musical Instrument Digital Interface
        Midis are sequenced music files made on keyboards. They’re usually really small and often sound great, although it largely depends on your soundcard. Midi collections are one of the few places in the world where you can find classic game and movie music, and for that I salute them.
        I use » WinAmp.</LI>
        <BR>
        <LI>MP3 — MPEG Layer 3 sound file
        Singlehandedly caused a revolution. MP3 is a sound file format which is highly compressed, which allows download-happy filesizes and excellent quality. Has caused much grief for the music industry as songs are now small enough to be traded online.
        Get the superb » WinAmp for the best player around.</LI>
        <BR>
        <LI>MPEG/ .MPG — Motion Picture Experts Group file
        One of the standards for streaming movies.
        » WinAmp can play movies. Or you could use » Windows Media Player, by Microsoft.</LI>
        <BR>
        <LI>MOV/ .QT — QuickTime MOVie
        The QuickTime format was designed by Apple and originated on the Mac, but has made the transition to the PC and is hugely popular.
        Get the » QuickTime Player for all your moving picture needs.</LI>
        <BR>
        <li>PDF — Portable Document Format
        Adobe Acrobat files were invented so that documents could be transferred between computers and indeed platforms, and still look the exact same, something which can’t be said about HTML files...
        the » Acrobat Reader to make sense of these things. It just reads them, mind. It costs if you want to make your own.</LI>
        <BR>
        <LI>PNG — Portable Network Graphics
        PNGs are a file format designed to be used in place of GIFs. They are usually slightly smaller, and sport advanced features like alpha-channel transparency and 24-bit colour support. Read more on our image formats page.
        Your browser can view them.</LI>
        <BR>
        <LI>RAM — Real Audio Movie
        Real Networks created formats for streaming audio and video, and gave away free players for the formats, before allowing themselves to become so smothered in advertising that everyone with sense decided to stop using their programs.
        You might still come across real audio files around the net, so hand over all your personal details to get whatever player » Real are trying to sell you this week.</LI>
        <BR>
        <LI>RAR — RAR archive
        This is a compressed file format similar to the popular .zip format. It sports advanced functions like special multimedia compression and has many benefits over zip files.
        Get the excellent » WinRAR to take care of your RAR archives, and it can handle other archive types too.</LI>
        <BR>
        <LI>TIFF — Tagged Image File Format
        For really high quality images, TIFFs are used, but cannot be viewed through a browser.
        Your only choice is to get a — Hooray! — image editor.</LI>
        <BR>
        <LI>TXT — TeXT file
        The most basic of files, it’s just some text.
        You no doubt already have either NotePad, SimpleText, or your browser, which you umm... definitely have.</LI>
        <BR>
        <LI>WAV — WAVe sound file
        A basic, either un- or not very- compressed sound file, usually used for short sound samples.
        Your computer will be able to play these anyway (when it turns on and sings it’s playing a .wav). Get » WinAmp for more power.</LI>
        <BR>
        </LI>ZIP — ZIPped file
        Zipped files are really groups of other types of files kept together and compressed a bit. Many downloads will consist of zip collections, so be sure to have something to open them with.
        » WinZip is the best shareware program for unzipping files and making your own zips.</LI>
