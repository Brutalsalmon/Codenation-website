<h2>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
<p> IT has become more and more important to the functionality and existence of a modern day business. If not for it's ability to improve efficiency IT has become the lifeblood of some organisations in many different ways.

IT infrastructure enables companies to scale up their teams sizes, monitor data, reduce errors etc...
Software can be customised to create E-Commerce ventures, collect analyse and highlight data, reduce the need for hardware, automate processes etc...
A great overview of this can be found at <a href="https://www.business2community.com/tech-gadgets/importance-information-technology-business-today-01393380"> here.</a>

<h2>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h2>
<p>Given the nature of Software Development is to create there are literally thousands upon thousands of applications we use. For this project I wanted to use the likes of:</p>
<p></p>

Trello. I've used Trello for a few years now to track my projects, my workflow and help me prioritise.
<p></p>
Slack - Again, another tool I've come to use frequently. It's a great place to centralise/share data as well as communicate all on one platform. That and it is a core tool on this course so it makes sense to use it.
<p></p>
VSCode - Visual Studio code will enable me to create my website and create code in a suitable environment to deploy it
<p></p>
Stackoverflow - "Stack Overflow is an open community for anyone that codes. We help you get answers to your toughest coding questions, share knowledge with your coworkers in private, and find your next dream job". [2]
<p></p>
Kanban - Kanban is a project management methodology that consists of categorising your work load into a time-lined state of "workload", "doing", "review" and "done". It helps you focus on the priority of work within a project and can help efficiency.
<p></p>
Pair programming - Whilst I have to complete this project on my own. I'd like to see if I can possibly practice paired programming with either my tutor or another student watching a shared screen whilst I code to highlight errors etc..
<p></p>

<h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</h2>
<p>Before I go into the coding part of if I want to look at what other websites are out there, what research I can put together to build a concept.
<p></p>
Once I've done this I can then have a look at what particular functions are available and use websites like stackoverflow and Github to discover code samples.

From there I'd break it down into areas of project delivery so aspects like:
<ul>
    <li>Main page</li>
    <li>Additional pages</li>
    <li>Design / style</li>
    <li>Linking the pages</li>
    <li>Additional features.</li>
</ul>

In conjunction with using trello and kanban methods to create a priority list and timeframe I think it will help me to complete everything on time.

<h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h2>
<p>There are many risks that could befall an digital project from hardware failure to project timeframes etc... [3] Manchester Digital wrote a fantastic article stating that the top reasons are:
<p></p>
Short term priorities taking over
The initial scope was poorly defined (and the initial strategy / vision was unclear)
Trying to do too much work all at once
Silos between marketing and IT
Given this is a solo based project I believe the main challenges are going to be:
<p></p>
Learning new languages like HTML, CSS and Javascript. Being able to pick up new formats and syntax would be time consuming and also reduce how efficiently I am able to produce something. I plan to help myself to adapt by putting in additional hours with the likes of Freecodcamp, Udemy and Shaw Academy. 
<p></p>
Time management - Possibly taking too long on writing a certain function etc...

<h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h2>

<p>For this particular project the scope will be quite limited but I can already see that I will need to use the same tools such as: Python, Visual Studio Code, Trello and SLACK.</p>
<p></p>
The main thing I would want to consider with any software I'm using is whether or not it helps me to become more efficient in my job. Things like visual studio are a necessity to be able to code however, the likes of Trello, padlet and SLACK are great, free tools that can help you manage your project and communicate with a team effectively.
<p></p>
Zapier are a well known software development company that work on connecting applications that currently have no way of working together. In this article they state that you need to consider:
<p></p>

How to Pick the Best Software:

Focus on Your Business
Analyze Your Needs
Do Research
Don't Scrimp
Ask for Help
Customize Apps for Your Needs
Integrate Everything
Get Everyone Onboard
Communicate
Share Your Favorite Software

<h2>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control</h2>

<p></p>

<P>Trello - has helped in the sense that it gives me a visual aspect to my workflow. It helps me be aware of how much work I have to do, how to prioritise it and set realistic expectations of what I can achieve in the given time frame. Like SLACK and GitHub it also helps to create centralised places in which I can easily access my resources, code, notes etc.... Helping me to ensure good documentation along the way.
<p></p>
Another aspect that I hadn't considered is that with the "doing, review, redoing" aspect it also forces me to check on the quality of my work. This again could also help me in making sure I'm picking up errors on the way as I build as opposed to getting to the end of the project and then having to rush to complete everything.

"Having a GitHub repo makes it easy for you to keep track of collaborative and personal projects - all files necessary for certain analyses can be held together and people can add in their code, graphs, etc. as the projects develop. Each file on GitHub has a history, making it easy to explore the changes that occurred to it at different time points. You can review other people’s code, add comments to certain lines or the overall document, and suggest changes. For collaborative projects, GitHub allows you to assign tasks to different users, making it clear who is responsible for which part of the analysis. You can also ask certain users to review your code. For personal projects, version control allows you to keep track of your work and easily navigate among the many versions of the files you create, whilst also maintaining an online backup."

<h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h2>
<p></p>
Since the creation of the internet companies have been able to collect data on customers, visitors to a site etc... with no real governing body to review the security or safety of peoples private information. As a result the GDPR act has been created.
<p></p>
What is GDPR [9]:

This regulation has been implemented in all local privacy laws across the entire EU and EEA region. It will apply to all companies selling to and storing personal information about citizens in Europe, including companies on other continents.
<p></p>
What GDPR means is that citizens of the EU and EEA now have greater control over their personal data and assurances that their information is being securely protected across Europe.
<p></p>
According to the GDPR directive, personal data is any information related to a person such as a name, a photo, an email address, bank details, updates on social networking websites, location details, medical information, or a computer IP address.
<p></p>
There is no distinction between personal data about individuals in their private, public or work roles – the person is the person. Also in a B2B setting, everything is about individuals interacting and sharing information with and about each other. Customers in B2B market are obviously companies, but the relationships that handle the business topics are people – or individuals.
