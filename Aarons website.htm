<h2>My Interests in Technology and coding</h2>
<p>Whilst I've always had an interest in coding I didn't really explore it until I started working in Software Development recruitment. I enjoy the opportunity that it gives you to create new and different solutions. I love the idea that you can always improve on what you've done and that there are lots of different possibilities.</p>

<h2>Why I joined Code Nation</h2>
<p>As well as working for the owner Andy Lord a few years ago I had heard about code nation through my own network. I love the community and positivity that they promote and think it's fantastic that they can put on courses like this.</p>
