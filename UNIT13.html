<h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h2>
<p> Relying on product and team managment tools such as Trello, SLACK etc... removes an element of physicality and culture from the team dynamic as well as making realtime feedback potentially difficult unless it's arranged as part of a meeting.

    I could have been more efficient had I had more time to plan and execute my ideas. This way I could further review my code and experiment on the best ways to condense my code.
    
    In terms of teams, I'd imagine that this project would work well in a team environment as each member of the team could take a page and create it based around a theme decided as a whole, using something like slack to share information.
</p>

<br>

<h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>
<p>Whilst I've already covered software that helps make me more efficient I also wanted to mention the need to step away from the computer once every hour to move around, refocus my eyes, stay hydrated and generally just covering good mental and physical health.

    I've also used a stand up desk which I've found very helpful in adjusting my working posture, reducing aches and allowing me to work comfortably.</p>

<br>

<h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h2>
<p>The changes I would make are: 
    <P></P>
    To use the range of ideas with a team to create a mood board that will give a suggested theme of ideas, colours etc.... to get a uniformed theme between team members
    <P></P>
    Delegate a page to each member of the team or a team of 2 
    <P></P>
    Implement Testing at regular intervals, this could be done by using Visual Studio Code as well as Githubs version control.
    <P></P>
    Use some sort of timer to help focus certain timeframes I think having a team could definitely make things easier as a whole given you could then break up the tasks. 

<br>

<h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>
<p>I would use the inbuilt bug testing facility in Visual Studio Code to look for errors etc.... I would also use github for testing purposes and then finally look into pair programming asking the tutors advice (where appropriate).</p>
